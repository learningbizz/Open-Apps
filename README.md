# Open-Apps

## Summary

The idea behind this little project was that I wanted to **automate a small task that I do routinely:**
```
Open a set of apps for a unique purpose, such as programming.
```

To automate this task, I created different presets for the different set of apps I want to open.  

For example, for programming, I created a preset that opens: 
* Visual Studio Code 
* Firefox
* Terminal with the Python folder path  
* Spotify 


## Extra

If you want to make it so you can execute this in any directory and with only one word, **create an alias for it**  

If you want to make the alias **permanent** --> Edit the bash_aliases or .bashrc doc in ~/ if you use a bash, else edit the .zshrc file if you use ZSH bash.
